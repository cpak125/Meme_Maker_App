# Meme Maker App

Developed a simple meme maker app. This app was developed referencing Avanthika Meenakshi's meme maker app tutorial. Upon entering into the app, users select a base image, from the gallery, to use for a meme. After clicking on an image from the gallery a modal appears, from which the creation of the actual meme takes place. From this modal users can add text to the top and bottom of the image, drag and reposition the text and download the meme.
